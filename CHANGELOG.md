# Changelog

All notable changes to this AEC implementation. Format roughly follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) but adapted for the
research-arc workflow used here. Each version entry links to the canonical
verdict / closure doc under [docs/](docs/) for full evidence.

Versioning: `__version__` in [python/aec.py](python/aec.py) tracks the
production-graded BALANCED preset. `v3.x.y` jumps when a new production change
ships into BALANCED; `v3.x` arc closure (collection of NEUTRAL closures + arc
documentation) bumps `x`.

Bench standard for every entry below: 800-case AEC Challenge corpus,
`preset=balanced / fl=832 (52 ms) / cng=True / -j 4`. Listen evidence cited
when verdict requires it.

## [3.15.0] — 2026-05-15 — v3.15 arc closeout (Arc T detector default ON)

**Headline**: Zero ship-able algorithm changes; one preset default flip
(Arc T cohort tail real-time detector → BALANCED default ON, byte-equal
on audio output). Six candidate arcs CLOSED CANNOT SHIP after exhausting
their structural ceilings. Six default-OFF substrate flags retained for
v3.16 retry. v3.16 RES refactor plan authored with 13 ranked candidates
(5 with predicted Δ ≥ +0.005); v3.16 cycle authorised pending phase
kickoff.

### Production-affecting (BALANCED preset behaviour)

- **§10.S0b** (`5bb2fa8`): `arc_t_cohort_detector=True` in BALANCED.
  Cohort tail real-time detector populates `AecStats.cohort_tail_T`
  per-frame and writes `self._arc_t_cohort_tail_signal` field. All
  consumers (5 `arc_m_t_gated` gates + 1 RES preempt path) require
  additional default-OFF flags, so detector ON is **byte-equal on audio
  output** — only diagnostic state changes. 5/5 sanity case byte-equal
  PASS (NE / DT / DT_movement / FS / FS_movement, atol=0.0).
  - Why: enables v3.16 RES refactor consumers (Phase 3 candidates
    v3.16-A force_render OR-in / v3.16-B ENR-path lift) to read the
    signal without per-bench env-flag flipping.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_15_arc_t_s1_design_and_verdict.md](docs/v3_15_arc_t_s1_design_and_verdict.md)

### Bug fixes shipped

- **§1.0.S1 B4** (`3860335`): drop dead `'converged'` branch in
  quiescent re-sync (`_prev_filter_state` checks). The string belonged
  to `AecFilterState` enum vocabulary, not the internal P3f state
  machine — the branch was structurally unreachable. Cleanup removes a
  code-clarity hazard; behaviour byte-equal on production paths.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_15_b4_verdict.md](docs/v3_15_b4_verdict.md)
- **§1.0.S2 B5** (`bb9076f`): `_shadow_copy_err_baseline` doc aligned
  with actual implementation as RESERVED (declared but not wired —
  future arc scope). Doc-only change.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_15_b5_verdict.md](docs/v3_15_b5_verdict.md)
- **§10.S0c B9** (`1323f92`): bench tooling `--workers` CLI flag +
  per-scenario chunk-split (`n_chunks = workers // 3`); 800-case bench
  ~2× speedup over hardcoded `max_workers=3`. Byte-equal sanity 120/120
  between j=3 and j=6 outputs.
- **§1.5b naming** (`03e311b`): renamed `arc_m_v3_t_gated_enabled` →
  `arc_m_t_gated_enabled` per project naming convention (drop numeric
  version suffix from live config field names; keep arc-codename
  prefix as identifier).

### Closed CANNOT SHIP (no production change; default-OFF substrate retained)

- **§1.2 DT-NE compression fix** (`81f59bf`): per-state ENR + per-bin
  override candidates (full + per-bin only). Both fail FS Δecho bars
  3.8–10× over. Same family as v3.13 E5: filter-protection mechanism is
  trade-off-bound. Substrate `dt_ne_compression_fix=False` retained.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_15_dt_ne_compression_fix_closure.md](docs/v3_15_dt_ne_compression_fix_closure.md)
- **§1.4 Arc M V1+V2** (`92f264b`): EPC-gated per-band Kalman Q boost.
  V1 (0.5/1.0/2.0) FS_movement −0.027; V2 (0.7/1.0/1.5) cohort tail
  −0.053. EPC ⊃ cohort tail catastrophe windows — boosting Q during
  EPC-active windows boosts Q during catastrophe windows. Substrate
  `arc_m_epc_gated` retained.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_15_arc_m_closure.md](docs/v3_15_arc_m_closure.md)
- **§1.4 Arc G** (`acd2f2d`): per-band W reset on detected gain-change
  drift. ERLE Δ=−1.48 dB / 0/5 audible improvement on listen cohort.
  Destructive zero-out; v3.16 candidate C8 considers non-destructive
  partial decay. Substrate `arc_g_per_band_w_reset` retained.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_15_arc_g_closure.md](docs/v3_15_arc_g_closure.md)
- **§1.5 Arc T S2 RES preempt wiring** (`3d77486`): two independent
  no-op bugs proven by single-case smoke test on `qNvSMyU` (output
  bit-equal ON vs OFF):
    - **H1** (`over_sub × 1.3`): DEAD CODE in BALANCED — `over_sub`
      only read by `gain_type='wiener'`; all 5 presets use `'enr'`.
    - **H2** (`_using_render_based = True`): OVERWRITTEN 1 line later
      by `_residual_est.compute_residual_echo()` state machine.
  Substrate `arc_t_res_preempt_mode` retained for code symmetry; v3.16
  candidates v3.16-A / v3.16-B fix the integration patterns.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_15_arc_t_s2_wiring_closure.md](docs/v3_15_arc_t_s2_wiring_closure.md)
- **§1.5b Arc M.v3 T-gated rescue** (`03e311b`): wraps 5 `_arc_m_q_boost`
  call sites with `(arc_m_t_gated_enabled AND _arc_t_cohort_tail_signal)`
  gate. Subset 60-case bench: V1 ΔERLE_lin == M.v3 ΔERLE_lin in EVERY
  bucket EVERY decimal (linear filter byte-equal C1 vs C2). Per-case
  MD5 verified on `qNvSMyU` — ours.wav identical between V1 and M.v3.
  Trace: 4/5 q_boost fires at signal=False (rising-edge events fire AT
  boundary of signal assertion); 1/5 at signal=True was on shadow
  filter (S-orth.A decoupled, no main-output path). Structural
  timing/scope mismatch — discrete-event signals don't pair with
  persistent-state signals without designed temporal alignment.
  Substrate `arc_m_t_gated_enabled` retained. v3.16 candidate C7
  documents 3 retry options (α predictive signal / β post-assertion
  hysteresis / γ per-filter dispatch).
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_15_arc_m_v3_closure.md](docs/v3_15_arc_m_v3_closure.md)
- **§1.6 Arc F per-band Kalman Q schedule** (`415e8ec`): cohort tail
  damage. Substrate `kalman_q_per_band` + `kalman_q_band_scales`
  retained — paired with Arc M V1 substrate (V1 reproduction needs
  THREE flags atomically).
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_15_arc_f_closure.md](docs/v3_15_arc_f_closure.md)

### Audited but produced no actionable work

- **§1.7 RES audit** (`04c1dfe`): 60-case directional audit on the
  v3.15 closeout substrate. Headline finding: `ne_g_floor` fire-rate
  0.93 → **0.000 on DT** — v3.14 Arc P + R raise `spectral_g_min`
  enough that the `max(spectral_g_min, ne_g_floor)` comparison never
  picks `ne_g_floor`. v3.13 verdict's "universal baseline floor" no
  longer holds on v3.15 substrate. Adds NEW v3.16 candidate **C1b**
  (`ne_g_floor` removal) alongside C1 (`epc_dt_cap` removal — still
  0/all-buckets, doubly dead).
  - Sample bias: `--n-cases 60` enumerated alphabetical-first cases,
    all in `doubletalk/` scenario (40 DT_static + 20 DT_movement);
    0 FS / 0 NE / 0 cohort_tail. 800-case re-audit at v3.16 phase
    entry mandatory.
  - Audit + plan: [docs/v3_15_res_audit_and_refactor_plan.md](docs/v3_15_res_audit_and_refactor_plan.md)

### v3.16 candidate plan (13 candidates, 5 phases, 21–30 sprints)

| Phase | Candidates | Sprints |
|---|---|---|
| 0 housekeeping | HK-1 (B3 CNG seed), HK-2 (pcb1N patch), C1 (epc_dt_cap removal), **C1b (ne_g_floor removal — substrate-shift)** | 3 – 4 |
| 1 foundation | C5 (per-state RES interface), C6 (DelayEst audit ⭐ critical gate) | 4 – 5 |
| 2 RES refactor | C2 (ENR per-state × per-band), C3 (4-cap reorder), C4 (noise_floor / CNG) | 6 – 9 |
| 3 Arc T consumers | v3.16-A (force_render OR-in), v3.16-B (ENR-path lift) | 4 – 6 |
| 4 Arc M / G retry | C7 (Arc M.v3 α/β/γ), C8 (Arc G non-destructive decay) | 4 – 6 |

**C6 DelayEst audit** is a critical gate — 5 movement-related v3.15
closures (cohort tail, Arc M V1 FS_movement, Arc F cohort tail, Arc G
destructive W reset, §1.1 H5 DT-NE hypothesis) share echo-path-changing
substrate where DelayEst tracks. If audit confirms DelayEst is the
upstream cause for ≥ 30 % of those wall magnitudes, Phase 3-4 ROI
estimates change.

### Inherited debt (carried to v3.16)

- **v3.13 E2 Path 3 DT debt** (DT_static −0.050, DT_movement −0.025):
  remains unrecoverable in v3.15 production. Closure target moves to
  v3.16 RES refactor (C2 / C4 / C3 totalling +0.005 to +0.040
  predicted DT bucket recovery).

## [3.14.0] — 2026-05-14 — v3.14 arc (per-band ERL/ENR + decoupled shadow)

**Headline**: Three production changes ship to BALANCED — Arc P
(adaptive per-band ERL EMA), Arc R (per-band ENR thresholds with
`block_lf` tilt), Arc S-orth.A (decoupled shadow Kalman state). First
mechanism in 5+ shadow-retirement attempts that produces genuinely
independent shadow Kalman state. Arc H (Huber loss) closed CANNOT
SHIP after H.S1 — real listen mic saturation is bounded NL residual
floor, not impulsive gradient spike. Arc D (filter-state-aware RES
policy) substrate shipped on `feature/v3.14-arc-d` but not merged
(deferred to v3.15 then v3.16).

### Production-affecting (BALANCED preset behaviour)

- **Arc P P.S3** (`9162d78`): adaptive per-band ERL EMA driven by
  `error_psd / far_lw` (Option B source signal). Replaces scalar
  `erl_estimate=0.3` (7× over-estimate in low-coupling rooms) with
  3-band LF/MF/HF EMA (α=0.99). Flag `f3_1_per_band_erl_adaptive=True`.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_14_p_s3_verdict.md](docs/v3_14_p_s3_verdict.md)
- **Arc R R.S2** (`5e3e96b`): per-band ENR thresholds with `block_lf`
  tilt (raise LF, lower HF). DT bucket +0.007 dB mean Δdeg on
  800-case; FS regression within −0.02 bar. 7-case xrtntuju listen
  verification: NE not damaged, FS not audibly leaking. Paired with
  `f3_1_per_band_erl_adaptive` for end-to-end per-band gate. Flag
  `res_per_band_enr=True`. R.S2.1 admit_hf control later confirmed
  block_lf winner direction; FS_static intrinsic cost is per-band ENR
  mechanism overhead, not direction-dependent.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_14_r_s2_verdict.md](docs/v3_14_r_s2_verdict.md)
- **Arc S-orth.A** (`8089974` + `f08ddbf`): decouple shadow's Kalman
  `_error_psd` + `R` from main's. 800-case GREEN PASS — all 5 buckets
  within bar; cohort tail `qNvSMyU` Δecho +0.0036; state correlation
  drops main vs shadow 0.99 → 0.47 on DT_static (target 0.5–0.7 hit).
  Includes Option B quiescent re-sync safety regularization (10% blend
  toward main when 3× drift in steady FS). Flag
  `shadow_state_decoupled=True`.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_14_s_orth_a_s2_verdict.md](docs/v3_14_s_orth_a_s2_verdict.md)
- **Housekeeping B1 + B2** (`5fbceb0`): `PBFDKF.reset()` cleanup
  (unconditional `delattr` of `_p_max_override_frames`); `AecStats`
  `filter_state` enum/string contract aligned at API boundary.

### Closed CANNOT SHIP (substrate retained)

- **Arc H Huber loss** (`feature/v3.14-arc-h` HEAD): synthetic
  clipping (19.8% bursts) Huber δ ≥ 0.30 identical to L2 (no clipping
  trigger), smaller δ degrades. Real listen cases (01/02/07): Huber
  strictly worse than L2 for every δ. Impulse spike test confirms
  Huber works for true impulsive outliers — but real listen mic
  saturation = bounded NL residual floor (model mismatch), NOT
  impulsive gradient spike. Same physics wall as v3.13 E4/E5
  amplitude-domain closures. Substrate
  [`tools/research/v3_14_h_s1_huber_proto.py`](tools/research/v3_14_h_s1_huber_proto.py)
  preserved.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_14_h_s1_verdict.md](docs/v3_14_h_s1_verdict.md)

### Substrate shipped but not merged to BALANCED

- **Arc D filter-state-aware RES policy** (`feature/v3.14-arc-d`
  HEAD `0218906`): per-state ENR tuples + 4-cap on/off. 800-case
  bench Δ ≈ 0 on aggregate (only `suspicious_dt + diverged` states
  differentiate — rarely fire in production). Deferred to v3.15
  (which deferred it to v3.16 C2 candidate that subsumes Arc D's
  `coarse_learning` tuple into per-state × per-band ENR refactor).

- **Arc S-orth.B** L1-regularized shadow weight update
  (`feature/v3.14-arc-s-orth-b`): bucket means within hard abort bars
  (FS Δecho −0.013, DT Δdeg +0.000~+0.003) BUT two new large per-case
  FS outliers (`0KjzXA3g…` FS_static Δecho −1.557; `KSN5Jrzo…`
  FS_movement Δecho −0.704). NOT promoted; substrate retained for
  potential v3.15 / v3.16 S-orth.B.S3 retry.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_14_s_orth_b_s2_verdict.md](docs/v3_14_s_orth_b_s2_verdict.md)

### Volterra arc (research substrate, not what shipped as v3.14)

`feature/v3.14-volterra` carried the Volterra non-linear inverse arc
(S1 cohort baseline + S2 detector wiring + S3.0 joint Hammerstein
feasibility PASS, +2.99 dB mean ERLE on 5/5 NL). Branch was deleted
in v3.15 closeout cleanup; design lock + S2 audit + S3.0 verdict docs
preserved under [docs/v3_14_volterra_*.md](docs/). Volterra arc remains
listed as v3.16 Track 2 in the v3.15 plan §9 roadmap (re-authorisation
required if reopened).

## [3.13.0] — 2026-05-14 — v3.13 arc closure

**Headline**: Single production change shipped (E2 Path 3); two architectural
arcs (E4 NLP + E5 Saturation deepening) closed CANNOT SHIP after exhausting
their physics ceiling; back-end RES audit closed with limited refactor
surface. v3.14 Volterra design lock opens as the canonical breakthrough path.

### Production-affecting (BALANCED preset behaviour)

- **E2.S5 Path 3** (`5b1760c`): `eval_aec_challenge.py` `estimate_delay()`
  default `max_delay_ms` raised 250 → 1024 ms. Aligns bench pre-alignment
  with online F-DelayTrack search window. Closes 6/8 worst-FS listen cases
  that had residual delay 1200–10000 samples (75–625 ms) AFTER prior
  GCC-PHAT pre-alignment.
  - 800-case Δ vs v3.11.x baseline:
    - FS_static Δecho **+0.107**
    - FS_movement Δecho +0.018
    - DT_static Δdeg **−0.050** (accepted "RES unmasking" trade-off)
    - DT_movement Δdeg **−0.025** (accepted)
    - NE Δdeg −0.002 (within bar)
  - Listen: xrtntuju 5-clip DT regression 0 reg / 2 imp; cohort tail
    (qNvSMyU FS_static) Δecho −0.004 (within bar).
  - Trade-off deferred to v3.14+ per-state ENR refactor.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_13_e2_s5_verdict.md](docs/v3_13_e2_s5_verdict.md)

### Closed CANNOT SHIP (no production change; default-OFF substrate retained)

- **E4 NLP arc** (`3e10621`): 12 sprints S1–S6b. SubtractiveNLP detector
  validated (5/5 NL cohort listen, 0% NE FP after S4.1 cancellation-ratio
  gate). Suppressor (harmonic-pinned σ=50 Hz Gaussian mask) PROVABLY
  ATTENUATES (voice formants disappear at g_min=−30 dB) but **NO AUDIBLE
  NL REDUCTION** at any aggression level (S6a/S6b listen). Closure
  mechanism: multiplicative spectral mask `m[k,t] · Y[k,t]` only modulates
  amplitude; real NL is dominantly phase distortion + time-domain
  transients — unreachable by any amplitude mask family.
  - Detector preserved as default-OFF (`e4_nlp_enabled`); reused in v3.14
    as NL-frame identifier component of ensemble.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_13_e4_s6_verdict.md](docs/v3_13_e4_s6_verdict.md) +
    [docs/v3_13_e4_s6a_s6b_verdict.md](docs/v3_13_e4_s6a_s6b_verdict.md)

- **E5 Saturation deepening arc** (`c871a5d`): 4 sub-variants (S2/S3/S4a/S4b).
  All on FS-vs-DT trade-off line, slope ~0.5 dB DT loss per +1 dB FS gain.
  All FAIL DT Δdeg ≥ −0.005 hard bar by 4–10×. Mechanism: amplitude-layer
  detector cannot distinguish FS-NL frames from DT high-echo frames — same
  correlation signature in [0.7, 0.95] mic-peak band fires on both.
  - Detector (E5.S3 mic-lpb correlation gate) preserved; reused in v3.14.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_13_e5_closure_verdict.md](docs/v3_13_e5_closure_verdict.md)

### Audited but produced no actionable work

- **Phase 3 RES gain_floor 5-path audit** (`6cdfbb0`): Empirical fire-rate
  audit on 800-case BALANCED. Findings:
    - `epc_dt_cap`: 0/800 fires (DEAD CODE confirmed, removable)
    - `spectral_floor`: 97% on cohort tail qNvSMyU (LOAD-BEARING)
    - `ne_g_floor`: 88–99% all buckets, low skew 0.13 (Q7 V3 fragmentation
      hypothesis FALSIFIED — universal baseline floor, NOT main FS leak
      carrier)
    - `quiet_mask` / `divergence_floor`: physical fallback, KEEP
  - Canonical refactor surface SMALL (1 path removable, 1 absorbable);
    expected AECMOS delta ~ 0 (consistent with v3.12 5-NEUTRAL closure).
  - S6–S7 (canonical refactor) deprioritized; S8–S9 (4-cap audit + per-state
    ENR) deferred to v3.14+.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_13_phase3_res_audit_verdict.md](docs/v3_13_phase3_res_audit_verdict.md)

### v3.14 candidate items (deferred)

- **Volterra non-linear inverse filter (HIGHEST priority)**: 6+ month
  dedicated arc. Detector reuse from E4.S2 + E5.S3.
- Phase 3 RES canonical refactor (LOW, cosmetic)
- F-HFR per-band Q/R (LOW-MED, structural)
- E1 mic_dynamic_margin (LOW, 1 listen case)
- DT regression mechanism per-state ENR (MED)

## [3.12.x] — 2026-05-13 — Stage 1 RES exhaustion (NEUTRAL closure)

**Headline**: 5 NEUTRAL sprints (S6 / S6b / S7 / S10 / S11) targeting every
meaningful gate on ENR denominator and numerator. Stage 1 RES surface is at
local optimum — Δ ≈ ±0.001 on every bucket. No production change. Worst-FS
8-case listen redirected work to filter-side arcs (E1/E2/E4/E5), opening
the v3.13 plan.

### Notable

- Q3 / Q6 / Q7 RES architectural hypotheses fully falsified by 5-NEUTRAL +
  listen.
- v3.11.x retained as production ceiling.
- Verdict: [docs/v3_12_s6_s11_stage1_locked.md](docs/v3_12_s6_s11_stage1_locked.md)

### Sprints

- S6 / S6b: nearend_floor refinement variants — NEUTRAL.
- S7: dt_per_bin unified (third Q7 V3 carrier) — NEUTRAL ([docs/v3_12_s7_verdict.md](docs/v3_12_s7_verdict.md)).
- S8: noise_floor_psd dominant carrier diagnostic.
- S9: noise_floor_refine triple-trial null.
- S10: res_noise_floor_refined NEUTRAL ([docs/v3_12_s10_*.md](docs/)).
- S11: Cap2 FS-loosen NEUTRAL.

## [3.11.2] — v3.11 Phase 1 promotions, third tranche

### Production-affecting (BALANCED preset)

- `f_e1_enabled = True`: F-E1 ERL clip range extension + far_active hysteresis.
  - 800-case: NEUTRAL bench mean (Δ < 0.001), addresses extreme-ERL listen
    edge cases.
- `f_delaytrack_enabled = True`: F-DelayTrack continuous delay variance
  (replaces hard cut at confidence ≥ 0.5).
  - 800-case: NEUTRAL bench mean.

## [3.11.0] — v3.11 Phase 1 promotions, first tranche

### Production-affecting (BALANCED preset)

- `shadow_r_reset_enabled = True` (B5, Yang 2017 R-reset): symmetric R-reset
  on EPC (extends F2.3 to shadow filter's `_error_psd` + `R`).
- `f_e5_enabled = True` (F-E5 saturation 4-fix bundle):
  - mic soft-clip when sat_mic > 0.3
  - main mu sat-gate (freezes at sat_level > 0.5)
  - error_psd fast-attack reset on sat → clean transition
  - shadow_rise mask during saturation
  - sKXucFp4 single-case top: +0.348 dB Δecho
- `diverged_reset_enabled = True` + `diverged_reset_triple_and = True`:
  triple-AND gate (streak + shadow_advantage > 2.0 + filter_state == diverged)
  to avoid F2.2 EMA trap (which closed FAIL with 17 reg / 8 imp).

### Bench

- 5 buckets verdict OK; Δ < 0.001 dB vs v3.10.6 baseline; cohort tail
  qNvSMyU +0.010 linear preserved.

### Production-affecting (BALANCED preset)

- **F3.1 v3** (mic-excess gate + dt_per_bin blend): per-bin NE evidence,
  AUROC 0.871. Closes xrtntuju 5-clip DT NE-damage regression cohort.
- **F2.3** (epc_r_reset_enabled): EPC R-reset for main filter (Yang 2017
  pattern, single-filter scope).
- **F2.4** (mu_holdoff_no_reset): release-counter form of `_simple_mu_holdoff`;
  prevents marginal-DT counter resets.

## [3.10.5] — baseline reference (pre-v3.11 era)

The 800-case AECMOS reference snapshot used as the comparison baseline for
all v3.11+ work. Captured in `results/v3_10_5_main/scores.json`.

### Bucket means (800-case BALANCED)

| Bucket | n | echo (↑) | deg (↑) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| FS_static | 169 | 3.646 | 4.999 |
| FS_movement | 131 | 3.705 | 4.999 |
| DT_static | 186 | 4.221 | 2.323 |
| DT_movement | 114 | 4.053 | 2.368 |
| NE | 200 | 4.998 | 4.011 |

## Aggregate v3.10.5 → v3.13.0 (this release vs pre-v3.11 baseline)

Computed from `results/v3_10_5_main/scores.json` vs
`results/v3_14_baseline/scores.json` (rendered today on v3.13 closure HEAD;
v3.14 detector substrate is default-OFF so render = pure v3.13 behaviour).

| Bucket | Δecho | Δdeg | Source |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| FS_static | **+0.107** | 0 | E2 Path 3 |
| FS_movement | +0.018 | 0 | E2 Path 3 + Phase 1 micro-effects |
| DT_static | +0.014 | **−0.050** | E2 Path 3 (RES unmasking, accepted) |
| DT_movement | +0.005 | **−0.025** | E2 Path 3 (accepted) |
| NE | 0 | −0.002 | NE invariant preserved |

**Net**: FS bucket improved (Δecho +0.107 / +0.018), DT bucket trade-off
(echo micro-up, deg micro-down within bar), NE unchanged. Cohort tail
listen materially improved (E2 Path 3 closes 6/8 worst-FS listen edge
cases; xrtntuju 5-clip 0 reg / 2 imp).

## Earlier history

For v3.10.4 and earlier (v3.7 → v3.10.4), see canonical research log
[docs/SUMMARY.md](docs/SUMMARY.md). v3.7.1 is the most recent git tag
prior to v3.13.0; tags between v3.7.1 and v3.13.0 are P52/P53 milestone
tags rather than product versions:

- `p52-phase-a-closed-path3` (2026-05-12)
- `p52-phase-b-closed`
- `p53-design-locked`
- `p53-step-0-closed-T0E`
