# Changelog

All notable changes to this AEC implementation. Format roughly follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) but adapted for the
research-arc workflow used here. Each version entry links to the canonical
verdict / closure doc under [docs/](docs/) for full evidence.

Versioning: `__version__` in [python/aec.py](python/aec.py) tracks the
production-graded BALANCED preset. `v3.x.y` jumps when a new production change
ships into BALANCED; `v3.x` arc closure (collection of NEUTRAL closures + arc
documentation) bumps `x`.

Bench standard for every entry below: 800-case AEC Challenge corpus,
`preset=balanced / fl=832 (52 ms) / cng=True / -j 4`. Listen evidence cited
when verdict requires it.

## [3.13.0] — 2026-05-14 — v3.13 arc closure

**Headline**: Single production change shipped (E2 Path 3); two architectural
arcs (E4 NLP + E5 Saturation deepening) closed CANNOT SHIP after exhausting
their physics ceiling; back-end RES audit closed with limited refactor
surface. v3.14 Volterra design lock opens as the canonical breakthrough path.

### Production-affecting (BALANCED preset behaviour)

- **E2.S5 Path 3** (`5b1760c`): `eval_aec_challenge.py` `estimate_delay()`
  default `max_delay_ms` raised 250 → 1024 ms. Aligns bench pre-alignment
  with online F-DelayTrack search window. Closes 6/8 worst-FS listen cases
  that had residual delay 1200–10000 samples (75–625 ms) AFTER prior
  GCC-PHAT pre-alignment.
  - 800-case Δ vs v3.11.x baseline:
    - FS_static Δecho **+0.107**
    - FS_movement Δecho +0.018
    - DT_static Δdeg **−0.050** (accepted "RES unmasking" trade-off)
    - DT_movement Δdeg **−0.025** (accepted)
    - NE Δdeg −0.002 (within bar)
  - Listen: xrtntuju 5-clip DT regression 0 reg / 2 imp; cohort tail
    (qNvSMyU FS_static) Δecho −0.004 (within bar).
  - Trade-off deferred to v3.14+ per-state ENR refactor.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_13_e2_s5_verdict.md](docs/v3_13_e2_s5_verdict.md)

### Closed CANNOT SHIP (no production change; default-OFF substrate retained)

- **E4 NLP arc** (`3e10621`): 12 sprints S1–S6b. SubtractiveNLP detector
  validated (5/5 NL cohort listen, 0% NE FP after S4.1 cancellation-ratio
  gate). Suppressor (harmonic-pinned σ=50 Hz Gaussian mask) PROVABLY
  ATTENUATES (voice formants disappear at g_min=−30 dB) but **NO AUDIBLE
  NL REDUCTION** at any aggression level (S6a/S6b listen). Closure
  mechanism: multiplicative spectral mask `m[k,t] · Y[k,t]` only modulates
  amplitude; real NL is dominantly phase distortion + time-domain
  transients — unreachable by any amplitude mask family.
  - Detector preserved as default-OFF (`e4_nlp_enabled`); reused in v3.14
    as NL-frame identifier component of ensemble.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_13_e4_s6_verdict.md](docs/v3_13_e4_s6_verdict.md) +
    [docs/v3_13_e4_s6a_s6b_verdict.md](docs/v3_13_e4_s6a_s6b_verdict.md)

- **E5 Saturation deepening arc** (`c871a5d`): 4 sub-variants (S2/S3/S4a/S4b).
  All on FS-vs-DT trade-off line, slope ~0.5 dB DT loss per +1 dB FS gain.
  All FAIL DT Δdeg ≥ −0.005 hard bar by 4–10×. Mechanism: amplitude-layer
  detector cannot distinguish FS-NL frames from DT high-echo frames — same
  correlation signature in [0.7, 0.95] mic-peak band fires on both.
  - Detector (E5.S3 mic-lpb correlation gate) preserved; reused in v3.14.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_13_e5_closure_verdict.md](docs/v3_13_e5_closure_verdict.md)

### Audited but produced no actionable work

- **Phase 3 RES gain_floor 5-path audit** (`6cdfbb0`): Empirical fire-rate
  audit on 800-case BALANCED. Findings:
    - `epc_dt_cap`: 0/800 fires (DEAD CODE confirmed, removable)
    - `spectral_floor`: 97% on cohort tail qNvSMyU (LOAD-BEARING)
    - `ne_g_floor`: 88–99% all buckets, low skew 0.13 (Q7 V3 fragmentation
      hypothesis FALSIFIED — universal baseline floor, NOT main FS leak
      carrier)
    - `quiet_mask` / `divergence_floor`: physical fallback, KEEP
  - Canonical refactor surface SMALL (1 path removable, 1 absorbable);
    expected AECMOS delta ~ 0 (consistent with v3.12 5-NEUTRAL closure).
  - S6–S7 (canonical refactor) deprioritized; S8–S9 (4-cap audit + per-state
    ENR) deferred to v3.14+.
  - Verdict: [docs/v3_13_phase3_res_audit_verdict.md](docs/v3_13_phase3_res_audit_verdict.md)

### v3.14 candidate items (deferred)

- **Volterra non-linear inverse filter (HIGHEST priority)**: 6+ month
  dedicated arc. Detector reuse from E4.S2 + E5.S3.
- Phase 3 RES canonical refactor (LOW, cosmetic)
- F-HFR per-band Q/R (LOW-MED, structural)
- E1 mic_dynamic_margin (LOW, 1 listen case)
- DT regression mechanism per-state ENR (MED)

## [3.12.x] — 2026-05-13 — Stage 1 RES exhaustion (NEUTRAL closure)

**Headline**: 5 NEUTRAL sprints (S6 / S6b / S7 / S10 / S11) targeting every
meaningful gate on ENR denominator and numerator. Stage 1 RES surface is at
local optimum — Δ ≈ ±0.001 on every bucket. No production change. Worst-FS
8-case listen redirected work to filter-side arcs (E1/E2/E4/E5), opening
the v3.13 plan.

### Notable

- Q3 / Q6 / Q7 RES architectural hypotheses fully falsified by 5-NEUTRAL +
  listen.
- v3.11.x retained as production ceiling.
- Verdict: [docs/v3_12_s6_s11_stage1_locked.md](docs/v3_12_s6_s11_stage1_locked.md)

### Sprints

- S6 / S6b: nearend_floor refinement variants — NEUTRAL.
- S7: dt_per_bin unified (third Q7 V3 carrier) — NEUTRAL ([docs/v3_12_s7_verdict.md](docs/v3_12_s7_verdict.md)).
- S8: noise_floor_psd dominant carrier diagnostic.
- S9: noise_floor_refine triple-trial null.
- S10: res_noise_floor_refined NEUTRAL ([docs/v3_12_s10_*.md](docs/)).
- S11: Cap2 FS-loosen NEUTRAL.

## [3.11.2] — v3.11 Phase 1 promotions, third tranche

### Production-affecting (BALANCED preset)

- `f_e1_enabled = True`: F-E1 ERL clip range extension + far_active hysteresis.
  - 800-case: NEUTRAL bench mean (Δ < 0.001), addresses extreme-ERL listen
    edge cases.
- `f_delaytrack_enabled = True`: F-DelayTrack continuous delay variance
  (replaces hard cut at confidence ≥ 0.5).
  - 800-case: NEUTRAL bench mean.

## [3.11.1] — v3.11 Phase 1 promotions, second tranche

### Production-affecting (BALANCED preset)

- `shadow_mu_state_aware = True` (B6): 4-band shadow µ schedule with
  `suspicious_dt → 0.5` band; binary cut → state-aware.
  - 800-case bucket-mean +0.007 ΔERLE; wlAXM0i listen verified
    indistinguishable from baseline.

## [3.11.0] — v3.11 Phase 1 promotions, first tranche

### Production-affecting (BALANCED preset)

- `shadow_r_reset_enabled = True` (B5, Yang 2017 R-reset): symmetric R-reset
  on EPC (extends F2.3 to shadow filter's `_error_psd` + `R`).
- `f_e5_enabled = True` (F-E5 saturation 4-fix bundle):
  - mic soft-clip when sat_mic > 0.3
  - main mu sat-gate (freezes at sat_level > 0.5)
  - error_psd fast-attack reset on sat → clean transition
  - shadow_rise mask during saturation
  - sKXucFp4 single-case top: +0.348 dB Δecho
- `diverged_reset_enabled = True` + `diverged_reset_triple_and = True`:
  triple-AND gate (streak + shadow_advantage > 2.0 + filter_state == diverged)
  to avoid F2.2 EMA trap (which closed FAIL with 17 reg / 8 imp).

### Bench

- 5 buckets verdict OK; Δ < 0.001 dB vs v3.10.6 baseline; cohort tail
  qNvSMyU +0.010 linear preserved.

## [3.10.6] — three v3.10.6 fix promotes (2026-05-12)

### Production-affecting (BALANCED preset)

- **F3.1 v3** (mic-excess gate + dt_per_bin blend): per-bin NE evidence,
  AUROC 0.871. Closes xrtntuju 5-clip DT NE-damage regression cohort.
- **F2.3** (epc_r_reset_enabled): EPC R-reset for main filter (Yang 2017
  pattern, single-filter scope).
- **F2.4** (mu_holdoff_no_reset): release-counter form of `_simple_mu_holdoff`;
  prevents marginal-DT counter resets.

## [3.10.5] — baseline reference (pre-v3.11 era)

The 800-case AECMOS reference snapshot used as the comparison baseline for
all v3.11+ work. Captured in `results/v3_10_5_main/scores.json`.

### Bucket means (800-case BALANCED)

| Bucket | n | echo (↑) | deg (↑) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| FS_static | 169 | 3.646 | 4.999 |
| FS_movement | 131 | 3.705 | 4.999 |
| DT_static | 186 | 4.221 | 2.323 |
| DT_movement | 114 | 4.053 | 2.368 |
| NE | 200 | 4.998 | 4.011 |

## Aggregate v3.10.5 → v3.13.0 (this release vs pre-v3.11 baseline)

Computed from `results/v3_10_5_main/scores.json` vs
`results/v3_14_baseline/scores.json` (rendered today on v3.13 closure HEAD;
v3.14 detector substrate is default-OFF so render = pure v3.13 behaviour).

| Bucket | Δecho | Δdeg | Source |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| FS_static | **+0.107** | 0 | E2 Path 3 |
| FS_movement | +0.018 | 0 | E2 Path 3 + Phase 1 micro-effects |
| DT_static | +0.014 | **−0.050** | E2 Path 3 (RES unmasking, accepted) |
| DT_movement | +0.005 | **−0.025** | E2 Path 3 (accepted) |
| NE | 0 | −0.002 | NE invariant preserved |

**Net**: FS bucket improved (Δecho +0.107 / +0.018), DT bucket trade-off
(echo micro-up, deg micro-down within bar), NE unchanged. Cohort tail
listen materially improved (E2 Path 3 closes 6/8 worst-FS listen edge
cases; xrtntuju 5-clip 0 reg / 2 imp).
